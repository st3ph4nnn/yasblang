# yasblang

yasblang (yet another stack based {programming} language) is a programming language made and maintained by me.
developed using (mainly) concepts of forth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) with some adaptations.

little preview (does not include all the features, may be outdated):

# warning

the programming language is very barebones and not practical and usable for daily problem solving.  
when i will come to a stable state of the programming language, i will go ahead and make a WIKI page.  
for now, check the source code to learn how to use the programming language (yikes).

# compiling

compilation was tested currently on windows 10 with G++ 11.3.0 but it will surely run with linux and other g++ versions.  
to build, simply open the project folder, and type `make` in the console (make sure to install cmake on windows)

# little FAQ

> why another stack based programming language?

i have made it purely out of fun. it is not designed to be ran and used daily as a normal programming language
